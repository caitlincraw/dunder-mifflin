# Dunder Mifflin Infinity

Dunder Mifflin Infinity is a website [inspired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin_Infinity) by comedy television series, *The Office.* Browse our amazing paper selection in our e-commerce paperstore then head on over to the We Love Paper chatroom and talk about all things paper, life, and beyond. Friendships are to be made, conversations are to be had. Throughout the whole site, you even have access to a Dwight-bot who can respond to any and every request, although not always in the way you would expect (or maybe it is exactly in the way that you expect, since it is Dwight Schrute). It's [PAPER](https://dundermifflininfinity.surge.sh) time!
